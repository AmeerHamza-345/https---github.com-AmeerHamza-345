        "<li>Two numbers are generated from 1 to 100 (inclusive on both ends): one for you and one for a computer, who will be your opponent. You can see your number, but not the computer's!\n",
        "<li>You make a guess, saying your number is either higher than or lower than the computer's number\n",
        "<li>If your guess matches the truth (ex. you guess your number is higher, and then your number is actually higher than the computer's), you get a point!\n",
        "<li>These steps make up one round of the game. The game is over after all rounds have been played.\n"
